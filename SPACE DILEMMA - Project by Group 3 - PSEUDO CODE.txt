	Welcome to SPACE DILEMMA ... 

	You are a pilot of a small shuttle craft in the Dragon Blue Watch group of Space fleet 12

	There has been a distress / warning beacon message received from a clipper cargo ship in your fleet

	You are the nearest to the stricken ship and you have been choosen by the mothership to investigate 

	You shortly arrive at the stricken space ship and board it to investigate the problem 

	There are 4 crew and an android aboard the clipper ship

	There is a report of an oxygen failure on board, they say that there is approx. 1 hour oxygen left 
        and it's critical that this is fixed 

	You have room aboard your ship for yourself and (X) passengers (randomised)

	The nearest other rescue ship is (X hours) away (randomised)

	There may be issues with the communications (randomised)

	There may be problems with the Oxygen system ... (randomised)

	They urgently ask for your help ...

	Negative actions and bad decisions you make may have an negative impact on your health and the crew's health

	Positive actions and good decisions you make may have an positive impact on your health and the crew's health

	If you or the crew members health reaches zero then you (or they) will die

	Success is measured by saving as many crew members (as well as yourself) as possible!

	Failure is not an option! ....


  - Rules
  - Good choices increase user / team health %
  - Bad choices decrease user / team health %
  - You / team members cannot be greater than 100% health
  - if health % drops to 0 then that person dies
  - Current health status displayed every 5 goes, or when health drops to 10% or under

		- external damage - maybe fixable  (fix requires Welding Gun)
                - tool / repair fix required       (randomised)
  	- set distance to mothership
		- 120mins / 2 hours

  - Choice 
    - 1 Check Crew / User status
    - 2 Check Oxygen machine / status
    - 3 Check Comms status
    - 4 Check Mothership Status
    - 5 Your Ship Status

AFTER EACH CHOICE
    - perform the function required
    - update status based on the current random features
    	- if bad choice lessen health / increase damage
		- if anyone dead say so
		- if all dead goto end game
    	- if good choice improve health / decrease damage
		- if problem fixed goto end game 
	- Else 
		- update user with text of current situation
		- prompt for next choice

Scenario 1: - FIX FOR OXYGEN MACHINE INTERNAL

You check the status of the OXYGEN panel

The Oxygen readings are lower than normal ... you investigate further ...

There seems to be a strange noise coming from the machine.

What do you do?

1) Turn machine Oxygen machine off and back on again
2) Open Toolbox
3) Kick the oxygen machine to see if that fixes it
4) Open front panel

You select Option 4 : Open front panel

There seems to be a noise comming from inside... you move things around and discover that some of the components and fittings are a bit loose... 

What do you do?
